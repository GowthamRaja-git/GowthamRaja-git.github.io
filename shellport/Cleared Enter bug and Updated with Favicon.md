It looks like you have provided an HTML document that includes JavaScript code for a terminal-like interface. The issue you're encountering, where the Enter key is not working on your hosted GitHub site but works locally, could be due to a few different reasons. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Console for Errors:** Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element") and navigate to the "Console" tab. Look for any error messages or warnings related to your JavaScript code. Fixing any errors reported here might resolve the issue.

2. **Network Connectivity:** Make sure your hosted site on GitHub has proper network connectivity to external resources. Sometimes, if external resources are blocked or inaccessible, it can affect the functionality of your code. Check if you can access the jQuery library (https://ajax.googleapis.com) from your GitHub-hosted site.

3. **Relative Paths:** Ensure that your paths to external resources, such as the jQuery library and your stylesheet, are correctly set using relative paths. The paths should be relative to the root of your GitHub repository.

4. **File Names and Paths:** Check that the file names and paths for your JavaScript and CSS files are correctly spelled and case-sensitive. GitHub is case-sensitive, so make sure your file names and paths match exactly.

5. **GitHub Pages Configuration:** If you are using GitHub Pages to host your site, double-check your repository settings and GitHub Pages configuration. Make sure you are deploying the correct branch and that your HTML file is in the root directory of the branch being deployed.

6. **Caching Issues:** Sometimes, browsers can cache resources and prevent the latest changes from being loaded. Try clearing your browser cache or using a private browsing window to test the functionality.

7. **Event Listeners:** Ensure that your event listeners are set up correctly and are being triggered as expected. You might want to add `console.log` statements inside your event listeners to see if they are firing as intended.

8. **Syntax Errors:** Review your JavaScript code for any syntax errors or issues that might prevent it from executing correctly.

9. **Document Ready:** Make sure your JavaScript code is wrapped in a `$(document).ready()` function to ensure that it runs after the DOM has fully loaded.

10. **Browser Compatibility:** Test your site on different browsers to ensure that the issue is not specific to a particular browser.

By systematically checking and addressing these potential issues, you should be able to identify and resolve the problem causing the Enter key not to work on your GitHub-hosted site.
