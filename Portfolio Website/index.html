        <h3 class="bgmi">Started with Web Development</h3>
        <p class="description">Web Development :<br>
          1. Firstly, before Web Development, I started my coding Journey from my age of 15, with C.<br> ("The Mother of all languages").<br>

          2. C was a bit harder but, However I learnt it!!!. Then moved with C++ ("Updated C with OOPs.")<br>

          3. Later Started Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms using Cpp. It was interesting first,<br> Later started boring.<br>

          4. Then, Started Exploring Web Development, Enjoyed and Loved it So I Started Learning and doing Projects side by side. Frontend was interesting, when starting with Backend + DB, it started boring after few months, So again skipped and jumped into Learing JAVA.<br>

          5. Decided to Use my brain as a Processor, So I started Learning JAVA with DSA, It was very hard but i liked it so much, I loved it. Tried very hard not to quit and I made a decision to do it Consistently, Many Ups and Downs in that Journey, Many Unmotivated Days, least productive days Anyways, I pushed myself and did it.<br>

          6. Then Started Solving basic problems, Then moved on with Leetcode Problems, I was not able to solve my first leetcode Easy problem ("TwoSum") Even after seeing the Hints, I got demotivated and Depressed, Quitted all those things for a while.   <br>

          7. After Some Break, came up with motivation, motivated myself by solving problems from HakerRank, Learnt JAVA with OOP, started again with my first leetcode problem, I was able to Solve it, I was very happy and more motivated.<br>

          8. I Used to take breaks often, but i will continue, Started doing both Development and DSA. I have solved some 13 Leetcode problems and other problems too Which, i used to post it in my Github Repo for my Progress analysis and for Self Satisfaction.  <br>

          9. Used Resources : Youtube, W3Schools, Udemy, Neetcode, Strivers A to Z DSA Sheet, Kunal's WEMAKEDEVS.  <br>

          10. This was my complete Journey.
